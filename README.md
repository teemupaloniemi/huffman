# Huffman coding

This is a toy project of building a Huffman coder. 

## Using

1. Run `./huffman.py`
2. Follow the usage guide:
```
usage:
     dec <string to decode>
     enc <string to encode>

Example:
    >enc kissa istuu puussa
     10100011001010101010110001001010111011010110101001100111010110101010101010110

    >dec 10100011001010101010110001001010111011010110101001100111010110101010101010110
     kissa istuu puussa

Please use only items from this charset:

{CHARSET}

I try to parse everything else away, but have not accounted for everything."""
